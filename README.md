# SmartThings

This repo contains my custom development for the SmartThings environment.

As this time, the _smartapps_ directory contains original apps I've written. The _devicetypes_ directory contains existing devices I've tweaked for local preferences.

SmartThings developer info here: http://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/index.html

Issues (bug reports) and pull requests are welcome at https://github.com/chip-rosenthal/SmartThings
